/* You need to provide the solution to the testVector::compress routine. All
 * updates to the test vector set are to be done on the
 * testVector::testVectorSet member, so that the printCompressedTestSet method
 * produces the appropriate output.
 *
 * Also, remember to update members m1 and m2 with the first and second most
 * frequently occuring minterms for the final output 
 *
 * Do not make any changes to main.C. You are allowed to add members/methods to
 * the body of the testVector class, in addition to any stand-alone methods. My
 * solution, with debug statements, runs to 75 lines: as always, this means
 * that a simple solution is better than a complex one!  */
